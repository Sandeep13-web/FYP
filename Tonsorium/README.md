Tonsorium - Your stylist partner
Tonsorium is a salon appointment booking system where the users will be able to book their appointment at a salon in their preferred time, their needed makeover such as haircuts, dye, shave and others services. The users will also be able to choose particular staff for their makeover.

This system aims in helping the customers as well as the organization in order to easily book and keep record tracks of the booking and user information respectively. Customers will save their time while booking through this system which eliminates the traditional booking method.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
